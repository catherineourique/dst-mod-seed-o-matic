name = "Seed-O-Matic"
description = [[Seed-O-Matic: (almost) Friendly, automatic seed planter!

How It Work:
First you need to craft your Seed-O-Matic in the food crafting tab close to an alchemy engine.
Now place it close to farm soils. It will interact with a 3x3 tile grid, excluding itself.
Open your Seed-O-Matic internal inventory, It has a 3x3 grid where you should place your seeds.
Close it and TURN IT ON! IT'S DONE! JUST THAT!

Seed-O-Matic will fire seeds on the ground following the same placement pattern of its internal inventory, making your plants arranged as you like!

Recipe:

On your "Alchemy Engine", in "Food" tab:

* 1 Garden Digamajig
* 1 Gears
* 4 Broken Shell

Notes:

Seed-O-Matic does not ignore placement blocking, meaning that birds can prevent seeds to be planted.
Seed-O-Matic always turn off after throwing all 'planned seeds' defined on its start.
Seed-O-Matic is flamable.
Seed-O-Matic protect your house from zombies.
